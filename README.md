#coviutil 

Stand for Corona Virus (COVID-19)` Utilities. I want to have some data in tables. So I written some code. 

License: GPL v 2.0.


I have added some features. First one the help:
python covid19glodata.py --help 
or:
python covid19glodata.py -h . 

So now you can save the aggregate data, and/or you can add Death/Confirmed % ratio AND the recovered/Confirmed ratio % . 
Try:
python covid19glodata.py --ratio 
or
python covid19glodata.py --ratio --save 
and look for result in out.csv (it is a csv file so, you postprocess in excel or whatsoever you like). 

Stay tuned: I'm planning to add some chart and basic trend analisys. Let me know if you like the idea. 

TODO LIST:
* add an option to select a given country (-c ?) 
* add an option to select a given region 
* show some graph
* if the infection will continue, (I hope not) I will add some machine learning related functionnality. 
* your suggestion? 

Enjoy.
